Oh boy, here we go - writing more content for my experimental website platform and all that. SOOOOOOOOOOO simple :-D

I'm a big fan of the ability to just use a Markdown editor, and the general contribution interface is clean and simple. Looking forward to pulling some real contentent in here so I can try to model some nice pages/components around my own stuff.
